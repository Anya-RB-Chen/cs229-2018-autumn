Covariance is a measure of two random variables which indicates the positive or negative trend of the variables.
Covariance Matrix isÂ **a measure of how much two random variables gets change together**. It is actually used for computing the covariance in between every column of data matrix. The Covariance Matrix is also known as dispersion matrix and variance-covariance matrix.

Shape of Covariance Matrix: square matrix n * n with n = number of variables.
It is always symmetric: because Cov(A, B) == Cov (B, A)

$Cov(A, A) = Var(A)=\mathbb{E}(A^{2})-\mathbb{E}(A)^{2}$
