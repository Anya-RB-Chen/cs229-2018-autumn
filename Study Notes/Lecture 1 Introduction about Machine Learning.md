## Supervised Learning
You are given a dataset with $inputs\ X$ and *$labels\ Y$*, and your goal is to learn a mapping from $X$ to $Y$.

#### Regression Problem
The example of House and Price is called a "*Regression Problem*": the value you are trying to predict is continuous.

#### Classification Problem
The example of Malignent Tumor is called "Classification Problem": the value you are trying to predict is on a discrete number of variables.

#### Support Vector Machina
Allows you to use an infinite-dimensional vector (labels, features) to represtnt a predictive object.


## Unsupervised Learning
You are just given $inputs\ X$ with no Y, and your goal is to find insteretsting structure in this data. (e.g. clustering)

## Reinforcement Learning
Optimize the performance by no pre-setting, but try a lot of senerios and tell the model which is good and which is bad. (e.g. AlphaGo)
